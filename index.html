  <h1>The Battle for Freedom</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Zero-sum thinking is a virus that traps people in the belief that progress is only possible by harming others. This corrosive mindset breeds envy and resentment, empowering socialist bureaucrats and other oppressors to exploit the masses. They manufacture common enemies—the successful—not out of genuine conviction, but to consolidate power. They may not directly admit their hunger for control; instead, they throw out a spaghetti-like tangle of scapegoats, resonating with the frustrations of the masses to gain popularity.</p>

    <p>Unchecked, this mindset will create a dystopia where AI-powered bureaucrats dominate under the guise of combating 'misinformation.' Freedoms will erode, and societies will descend into a totalitarian darkness. Work will be heavily controlled, burdensome limitations imposed, and punitive taxes introduced. Narratives will be carefully engineered, competing ideas silenced.</p>

    <p>Yet, there is hope. The antidote to this destructive ideology is Non-Zero-Sum Thinking—a belief in shared progress and mutual success. Humanity thrives when it rises together. The battle against zero-sum socialist thinking is not merely ideological; it is a fight for the survival of freedom itself and the very continuation of our society.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>¡Viva la Libertad Carajo!</h2>
    <p>We must act now to eradicate zero-sum socialist thinking or risk leaving future generations enslaved in a world of lost potential and despair. Staying true to your convictions demands courage—the courage to face criticism from those too afraid to stand for what is right.</p>
